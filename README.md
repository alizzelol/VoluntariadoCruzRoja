# VOLUNTARIADO CRUZ ROJA

## Introduction
This is an application created to improve the organization at the Asociation Red Cross. 
At the moment, in the Red Cross, when you're a volunteer, the call you to set up a date and a time to carry out an event to help an user at the care of the Red Cross. My idea is to have an app where the Departament's head of the Voluntary can upload the events, setting the dates and times when they'll have to be made and the volunteers chose witch one they'll want to do.

## Goals
The goals of this application:
- To access been registered by the Department's head of the Voluntary, so only profesionals and volunteers will have access to the app.
- Profesionals can handle the users and events registered from the application.
- Volunteers can have access to the events uploads by the professional.
- Volunteers can sign up for the events they will want to do.

## Structure
This application have:
- Login to access the application by a private record.
- Two Rols: Admin(professional) and vol (volunteer)
- Admin:
  + They can access the application to register the users and the events.
- Vol:
