## Voluntariado Cruz Roja

# Introduction

This is an application created to improve the organization of the Red Cross regarding the distribution of tasks to volunteers by volunteer leaders. At the Red Cross, they have to call volunteers one by one to assign them a task to help users who are under the protection of the Red Cross.

# Objectives

* User registration is carried out by volunteer leaders (administrators), so only registered people can enter the application.
* Administrators manage users and events (tasks to be performed by volunteers).
* Volunteers can view available events to be performed.
* Volunteers can sign up for events.

# Structure

* Login, only for those people registered by administrators.
* Two Roles: admin and vol
    * Admin: manage users and events
